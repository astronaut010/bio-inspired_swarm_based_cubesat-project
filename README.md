This work is presented as a conceptual digital twin and idea-stage prototype, focusing on behavior and interaction rather than flight-qualified hardware

# Bio-Inspired CubeSat Attitude Simulator

This project demonstrates a simple CubeSat attitude simulator using
a web-based digital twin. The simulator applies disturbances and
stabilizes orientation using lightweight control logic inspired by
collective behavior in nature.

## Tech Stack
- Python (FastAPI)
- JavaScript (HTML + CSS)
- Web-based visualization

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Start backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload

3. Open frontend/index.html in browser

## Note
This is a demonstration-quality simulator intended for educational
and hackathon use, not flight-level accuracy.
